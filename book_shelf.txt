C++ Struct Problem
===================
In programing, we can define 'objects' that exist in our programming 
world. For example, we can say something like: There are things 
called cars, and they have a price, a license plate #, and model. Then, 
you can add properties like car.price, car.plate, car.model, etc.

* Read about random numbers:

* Make a struct object to describe a book: 
At a minimum, a book should have: author, genre, title. 

* Make a program that stores an array of books. We will treat the array 
like a book shelf. You should be able to: 
1. Add a book
2. Take a book
3. Take a random book.
4. Search for book. 
5. Quit



* Explanation of different functions
1. Will ask user for author/genre/title, and put book into an open
spot on the 'shelf'. Should tell user what spot it got put into. 
2. Will ask user for which spot on the book shelf they want to take book. 
3. Should use random number to choose which book to remove from shelf.
4. Will ask user for either title, year, or author. User then types it 
in, and program searches. It should reveal partial matches!!! I.E. 
If user searches by title, and types in "lord" book shelf should 
say it has "lord of the rings" in spot 5 and "lord of the flies" in 
spot 7. It should give ALL information for every match it finds. 
5. Quit
